# GIP

This was an old school project from highschool (in dutch called middleschool) called a GIP (geintegreerde proef). 
It's just a very basic html site, should normally be in 3 languages, no router, just plain html.
The html side was 1 part of the actual assignment where I was tasked to set up a business (combining the courses in my class (bookkeeping/economics and informatics))
